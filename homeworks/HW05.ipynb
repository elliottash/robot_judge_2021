    "\n",
    "*Suppose you are a policy advisor to a developing country government that would like to design a social security program to aid individuals with wages lower than \\$1000 per month. However, data collection in this country is very hard due to the lack of technology infrastructures, incentives to misreport income, and geographical barriers. Therefore, you have access to some demographic and employment data at the individual level from all the municipalities in addition to geographical and municipality level features (here, you can be creative about which variables you have access to). However, you have access to income data only for a random set of municipalities.*\n",

    "**There is no right or wrong answer here. This is just a conceptual exercise to make you think about the methods we are learning about in real-life problems.** You don't need to write a lot about this; 100 words or even a scheme about your solution to this task would be enough."

    "Another area of research that is increasingly employing machine learning is that of medical research (a great example of it is [Mullainathan and Obermeyer, 2021](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26168)). The correct prediction of who may encounter a critical clinical condition is fundamental for the allocation of treatments. Indeed, both treatment availability and doctors' time are not infinite. Therefore, correctly predicting who may be more likely to experience a heart attack or develop cancer is extremely important to help these people and not waste precious resources at the same time.\n",
